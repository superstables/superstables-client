## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-18

The first release of the Superstables client: a TypeScript SDK, a local MCP server and a CLI
that let an agent find a service that charges per request, ask it what a call costs, and pay for
it — only after the owner has looked at the amount, the asset, the network and the recipient and
said yes.

The key stays where it already was. In the default mode that is MetaMask: the client serves an
approval page on `127.0.0.1`, the owner connects their wallet there, and MetaMask signs. The
agent can ask for a payment and can never approve one. This release is a testnet
demonstration — it pays in test USDC on Base Sepolia over [x402](https://x402.org) — so no real
money moves.

### The flow

- **Find.** List services that can be paid for, and say which ones the client can actually call
  and why the others cannot be.
- **Quote.** Read a service's HTTP 402 challenge and write down its exact terms. Free, and
  nothing is signed.
- **Approve.** `pay` stops and hands back an approval link. The page shows the amount, the
  asset, the network and the recipient, all derived from the seller's own payment requirement
  rather than from anything the agent said; what the agent claims the payment is *for* is shown
  separately and marked unverified. The owner approves in MetaMask, or in a local wallet
  process on a machine with no browser.
- **Pay.** A public facilitator submits the transfer and pays the gas, the service answers, and
  a receipt with the transaction hash is written.
- **Refuse.** A rejected payment — on the page or in MetaMask's own popup — signs nothing,
  submits nothing, and never calls the service. The agent is told so plainly.

### What is supported

x402 with the `exact` scheme, on Base Sepolia (`eip155:84532`), paying in USDC. Any other
scheme, network or asset is refused before the owner is asked to sign anything. There is no
mainnet switch and no unattended mode.

### Interfaces

Six MCP tools over stdio, for Claude Code, Claude Desktop or any other MCP client:

- `find_services` — search for payable services and say which are actionable
- `quote` — read a service's terms and record them; nothing is signed
- `pay` — ask the owner to approve a quote, return the `approval_url`, then pay and return the
  service's answer
- `payment_status` — wait for an attempt to finish and report where it got to
- `wallet_status` — which signer is in use, and its address, network, balance and policy
- `list_receipts` — the payments that settled on this machine

The `superstables` CLI does the same work from a terminal: `setup`, `doctor`, `find`, `quote`,
`pay`, `status`, `receipts`, `attempts`, `policy show` / `policy init`, `mcp`, `demo-service`,
and `wallet init` / `wallet serve` / `wallet status` for the local wallet. The same code is
published as a TypeScript SDK.

### Records and state

Every quote, attempt, approval and receipt is appended to JSONL files in `~/.superstables`, mode
0600, and nothing outside that directory is written. An attempt is an explicit state machine:
`awaiting_approval` → `denied`, `expired`, `failed`, or `approved` → `submitting` → `settled`,
`paid_service_failed`, `failed` or `uncertain`. `failed` means the money did not move and that
is known; `uncertain` means the credential left the machine and what became of it is not, and
the client never retries it automatically. A receipt exists exactly when money moved.

`policy.yaml` holds a per-payment cap, a daily cap, an allowed-host list and a kill switch.
These are checks in this software, on the owner's machine — not on-chain limits.

### Something to buy

Superstables hosts the demo seller, a real x402 market-data service on the testnet, so there is
something to pay for without anyone running a seller. The catalogue also lists a third-party
x402 service on Base Sepolia, run by an independent developer, so a payment to a seller nobody
at Superstables controls can be shown too. `superstables demo-service` runs the seller locally
for anyone who wants to watch that side of a payment.

### Claude Desktop bundle

`npm run bundle` builds `build/superstables-<version>.mcpb`, an MCP bundle that installs into
Claude Desktop through Settings → Extensions → Advanced → Install Extension…. Both Claude Code
and Claude Desktop have been tested end to end with the MetaMask flow.

### Known limitations

- Testnet only: one network (Base Sepolia), one asset (USDC), one scheme (x402 `exact`).
- MetaMask's signature popup shows the value in USDC's smallest unit, so `10000` is 0.01 USDC.
  The approval page prints the conversion, but the popup is what it is.
- Listings from the public Superstables index are shown but cannot be paid yet: the index does
  not record the request parameters a service needs, and each listing says so.
- An attempt that ends `uncertain` is never retried automatically; it has to be looked at.
- With `--wallet local` the key is a file on the machine, readable by any process running as the
  owner. That mode exists for a machine with no browser.
