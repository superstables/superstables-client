// Builds the Claude Desktop bundle: a single .mcpb file holding the MCP server, its compiled
// JavaScript and its production dependencies.
//
// `--dev` stamps the staged manifest and package.json with a version derived from the commit
// (`0.1.0-dev.14+gabc1234`), so that two development builds of the same release are never
// called the same thing and a desktop host cannot silently keep an older one. The repository's
// own files are never touched; only the staged copies, which are what ships.
//
// The bundle is staged rather than packed in place, for one reason: what ships must be exactly
// what the manifest promises. The staging directory gets the manifest, a package.json stripped
// down to runtime dependencies, dist/, the README and the licence — and then its own
// node_modules, installed with --omit=dev so no test or build tooling travels to a user's
// machine. Nothing is copied that the server does not need at run time; src/, test/ and the
// lockfile stay behind.
