// The version a development bundle carries, so that two builds of the same release are never
// called the same thing.
//
// The problem this solves is specific: a desktop host asked to install an extension whose
// version it already has may keep the copy it has. The build then looks installed and behaves
// like the old one, and nothing on screen says which is running. A version that changes with
// every commit removes the ambiguity — the host sees a new version, and whatever the client
// reports afterwards (`wallet_status`, `superstables --version`, the server's first stderr
// line) names the exact build.
//
// The stamp is `<version>-dev.<commits>+g<sha>`: a SemVer prerelease that sorts below the
// release it is derived from, plus the commit it was built at. Without git — a tarball, a
// machine with no git — a UTC minute takes the place of the commit count.
//
// Nothing here writes to the repository's own files. `scripts/bundle.mjs` applies the stamp to
// the staged copies alone, which are what ships.
