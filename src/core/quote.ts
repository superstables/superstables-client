// Quoting: find out what a paid endpoint charges, and say so, without paying anything.
// A 402 challenge is free to ask for, so a quote is a read: it costs nothing, signs
// nothing and commits to nothing. What it does do is freeze the facts — the amount, the
// asset, the recipient, the network — so the owner approves the same payment the agent saw.
// Everything a quote records comes from the seller's own requirement; nothing is inferred
// from the seller's self-declared resource URL, which the seller could write anything in.
