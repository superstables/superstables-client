// Signing with a browser wallet. This is the default signer, and the reason the person who
// runs an agent has no process of their own to start: the agent's process serves one approval
// page on loopback, the link goes back to the agent as part of its tool result, and the owner
// signs in MetaMask (or any other window.ethereum wallet) on that page.
//
// Like every signer here, this one holds no key and can approve nothing. What it adds is the
// two checks that happen before a person is ever asked: the requirement must be one this
// client can pay at all (termsFor), and the owner's own spend policy must allow it. Only then
// does an approval exist, and only then is there a link to open.
