// The signing seam. The payment code never sees a key: it builds a SignRequest from the
// seller's requirement and hands it to a Signer. Two signers exist:
//   BrowserWalletSigner the default. Holds no key. Serves one approval page on loopback and
//                 waits for the owner to sign in their browser wallet (MetaMask or similar).
//   WalletSigner  the agent side of the local wallet process. Holds no key. Posts the request
//                 to that wallet and waits for the owner's decision there.
//   LocalKeySigner the local wallet's own signer, and the one tests use. Never used by an agent.
