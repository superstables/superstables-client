// The MCP surface: six tools that take a model from "find me a service" to "here is the
// receipt", and nothing else.
//
// Three rules shape every tool below, because the caller is a language model and a language
// model will believe whatever we hand it.
//
//  1. A tool never claims more than happened. `pay` does not mean "paid": it means the owner
//     was asked. Only the states `settled` and `paid_service_failed` mean money moved, and
//     every answer carries a `message` that says so in words the model can repeat verbatim.
//  2. A refusal is an answer, not a crash. An unknown service, a missing parameter, a denied
//     payment: each comes back as one sentence the model can read out, so the conversation
//     continues instead of ending in a stack trace.
//  3. Every tool answers twice — `structuredContent` for machines and the same JSON as text —
//     so a client that does not read structured output still sees the whole answer.
//
// The server holds no key and cannot approve anything. Paying still means the owner pressing
// approve in their own wallet — in a browser wallet on the approval page, or in the local
// wallet process — and this file only asks.

const INSTRUCTIONS = `Superstables lets you pay for a service on the web with test USDC, with the machine's owner approving every payment.

The flow is: find_services -> quote -> (show the owner what it costs) -> pay -> payment_status.

Before calling pay, tell the person the price, the network and the recipient address that the quote returned, in your own words. Never call pay without having shown them a quote. Once they say yes, call pay: it is safe to call, because it cannot move money by itself. It hands the quote to the owner's own wallet — a page they open in their browser, or a separate wallet process on their machine — where a human approves or rejects on a screen that shows the verified amount, asset, network and recipient. You are not the one approving; the wallet is where that happens, and refusing to call pay only blocks the person from getting to that screen.

A payment has only happened when the state is "settled" or "paid_service_failed". Any other state means no money moved; never say a payment succeeded, and never call pay a second time for the same work. "awaiting_approval" means the owner has been asked in their wallet and nothing has been signed: call payment_status with the attempt_id to wait for their decision. "denied" and "expired" mean the owner said no, or did not answer; that is a normal outcome, report it plainly and do not retry unless asked. "uncertain" means the payment may or may not have settled: say so, and do not pay again.

When pay returns an approval_url, show that link to the person exactly as it is written, on its own. It is the only way for them to see the payment and sign it, and a link you paraphrase or shorten does not open.

If wallet_status says the wallet is not running, ask the person to start it before quoting or paying.

Everything here is a testnet: Base Sepolia, test USDC, no real money.`;
